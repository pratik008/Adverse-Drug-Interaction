# Drug Drug Interaction Prediction

This is a project to leverage Deep learning to predict drug-drug interactions.

## Motivation: 
Drug Interactions are a major cause for drug recalls and affect 5% to 30 % of all adverse events.  


## Presentation Slides
Further details regarding the motivation, methods and results of implementing this idea can be found in my presentation here : http://bit.ly/DrugInteractionSlides


## Install Scripts:
The package as well as the necessary requirements can be installed by running make or via

python setup.py install


## Training a Model:

For Training the model run the following train.sh script - there are 3 alternatives, ECFP, SMILES, Transfer_Learning


## Inference :

For Inference with multiple drugs, use the inference_from_file.sh script.
For single inference use the inference.sh script
